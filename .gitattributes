# Set default behavior for line endings:
* text=auto

# Explicitly mark files as binary (no line-ending normalization):
*.jpg binary
*.png binary
*.gif binary
*.pdf binary
*.zip binary

# Treat specific file types as text (helpful for cross-platform work):
*.cpp text
*.h text
*.py text
*.js text
*.java text

# Normalize line endings for text files
*.c text eol=lf
*.h text eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf
*.txt text eol=lf
